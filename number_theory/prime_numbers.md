# Prime Numbers

[Back to Number Theory](./index.md)

A **prime number** (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, \(1 \times 5\) or \(5 \times 1\), involve 5 itself.

## Key Properties and Theorems

*   **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**: Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers (up to the order of the factors). This is a cornerstone of number theory.

*   **Infinitude of Primes**: There are infinitely many prime numbers. This was famously proven by Euclid. His proof is a classic example of a proof by contradiction.

*   **Prime Number Theorem**: This theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they get larger. The theorem states that the prime-counting function \(\pi(x)\) (the number of primes less than or equal to \(x\)) is approximated by:
    \[ \pi(x) \approx \frac{x}{\ln(x)} \]

## Types of Primes

Mathematicians have studied many different types of prime numbers, often named after the people who discovered or studied them.

*   **Mersenne Primes**: Primes of the form \(2^p - 1\), where \(p\) itself must be a prime number. They are connected to the search for perfect numbers. The largest known prime numbers are often Mersenne primes.

*   **Fermat Primes**: Primes of the form \(2^{2^n} + 1\). Fermat conjectured that all numbers of this form were prime, but this was later shown to be false. For \(n=5\), the number is composite.

*   **Twin Primes**: Pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2. For example, (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19). The **Twin Prime Conjecture** states that there are infinitely many twin primes, but this remains unproven.

## Open Problems

The study of prime numbers is a rich area of research with many famous unsolved problems.

*   **Goldbach Conjecture**: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. For example, \(8 = 3 + 5\) and \(20 = 7 + 13\). This has been verified for very large numbers but remains unproven.

*   **Riemann Hypothesis**: This is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It concerns the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and if proven, it would have profound implications for the distribution of prime numbers.
