# Trigonometry

[Back to Geometry](./index.md)

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.

## Right-Angled Triangle Trigonometry

The most basic concepts of trigonometry are defined using a right-angled triangle. For a given angle \(\theta\) in a right-angled triangle, we can define the following trigonometric ratios:

*   **Sine (\(\sin\theta\))**: The ratio of the length of the side that is opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.
    \[ \sin\theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \]
*   **Cosine (\(\cos\theta\))**: The ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
    \[ \cos\theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \]
*   **Tangent (\(\tan\theta\))**: The ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
    \[ \tan\theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \]

The reciprocals of these functions are also important:
*   **Cosecant (\(\csc\theta\))** = \(1/\sin\theta\)
*   **Secant (\(\sec\theta\))** = \(1/\cos\theta\)
*   **Cotangent (\(\cot\theta\))** = \(1/\tan\theta\)

## The Unit Circle

For a more general definition, we use the **unit circle**, which is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin of the Cartesian plane. If we have a point \((x, y)\) on the unit circle, and a line from the origin to that point makes an angle \(\theta\) with the positive x-axis, then:
*   \(\cos\theta = x\)
*   \(\sin\theta = y\)

This definition allows for angles greater than 90 degrees and negative angles. The trigonometric functions become periodic with a period of \(2\pi\) (or 360Â°).

## Trigonometric Identities

Trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric functions and are true for every value of the occurring variables where both sides of the equality are defined.

*   **Pythagorean Identity**:
    \[ \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1 \]
*   **Angle Sum and Difference Identities**:
    \[ \sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sin\alpha\cos\beta \pm \cos\alpha\sin\beta \]
    \[ \cos(\alpha \pm \beta) = \cos\alpha\cos\beta \mp \sin\alpha\sin\beta \]
*   **Double Angle Formulas**:
    \[ \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \]
    \[ \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \]

## Laws of Sines and Cosines

For any triangle (not necessarily right-angled) with sides \(a, b, c\) and opposite angles \(A, B, C\):

*   **Law of Sines**:
    \[ \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} \]
*   **Law of Cosines**:
    \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C \]
    This is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.
