# Euclidean Geometry

[Back to Geometry](./index.md)

Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the *Elements*. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these.

## Euclid's Postulates

Euclidean geometry is based on five postulates:

1.  A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.
2.  Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
3.  Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.
4.  All right angles are congruent.
5.  **Parallel Postulate**: If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.

This fifth postulate is the defining one. Geometries where the fifth postulate is not true are known as non-Euclidean geometries.

## Key Concepts and Theorems

*   **Pythagorean Theorem**: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
    \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

*   **Angles**: The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

*   **Circles**: The circumference of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\), and its area is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius.

*   **Congruence and Similarity**:
    *   **Congruent** figures are identical in shape and size.
    *   **Similar** figures have the same shape but may have different sizes. Their corresponding angles are equal and the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant.

## Coordinate Geometry

In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes developed analytic geometry, which uses coordinates to describe geometric objects. In a Cartesian coordinate system (a plane with x and y axes), points are represented by pairs of numbers \((x, y)\), lines are represented by equations like \(y = mx + b\), and circles by equations like \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). This algebraic approach allows geometric problems to be solved using algebra.
